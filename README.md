<p>Bug fixing in code can start off rather simple, with obvious and recurring bugs easy to identify and root out. But eventually the bugs become harder to find and more difficult to fix. Instead of searching out errors one by one, getting to the root of the problem by enhancing your exception handling can turn your code base from chaos to clarity.</p>
<p>Learn how to handle errors and anomalies in your C++ code like a pro in this course with software engineer Károly Nyisztor. From the basics of exceptions to advanced techniques for robust error handling, Károly guides you through the nuances of exception handling, and explains how proper handling and logging make bugs easier to track and fix. </p>
<p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started.</p>
